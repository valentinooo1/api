## Introduction

APIs are essential for modern software development. They allow different software systems to communicate with each other. This repository focuses on providing a clear and efficient API that can be easily integrated into various applications. 

## Features

- **RESTful Design**: Our API follows REST principles, making it easy to use and understand.
- **JSON Support**: All responses are in JSON format, which is lightweight and easy to parse.
- **Versioning**: The API supports versioning, ensuring backward compatibility.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation helps developers understand how to use the API effectively.

## Getting Started

To get started with the API, you can visit [GitHub](https://github.com). This link will take you to the repository where you can find all the necessary files and instructions.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd api
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The API will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the API using tools like Postman or cURL. Below are some examples of how to use the API effectively.

### Example Request

To get a list of resources, send a GET request to:

```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/resources
```

### Example Response

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Resource 1"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Resource 2"
    }
]
```

## Endpoints

The API provides several endpoints for different operations. Below is a list of available endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint                | Description                  |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| GET    | /api/resources          | Retrieve all resources       |
| GET    | /api/resources/:id      | Retrieve a specific resource  |
| POST   | /api/resources          | Create a new resource       |
| PUT    | /api/resources/:id      | Update a specific resource   |
| DELETE | /api/resources/:id      | Delete a specific resource   |

## Authentication

For secure access, the API requires authentication. You can use an API key or token for this purpose. To obtain an API key, please follow these steps:

1. Sign up on our platform.
2. Navigate to the API section in your account settings.
3. Generate a new API key.

Include the API key in the header of your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Error Handling

The API provides clear error messages for various scenarios. Below are some common error responses:

| Status Code | Error Message                | Description                           |
|-------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 400         | Bad Request                   | The request was invalid.              |
| 401         | Unauthorized                  | Missing or invalid authentication.    |
| 404         | Not Found                     | The requested resource was not found. |
| 500         | Internal Server Error         | An error occurred on the server.     |
